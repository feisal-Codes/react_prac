Problem: Build a Recipe Management Application

You are tasked with creating a recipe management application
 in React. 
 The application should allow users to perform 
 the following actions:

View a list of recipes, including their names, 
ingredients, and instructions.

Add new recipes to the list.

Edit existing recipes, including updating their names, 
ingredients, and instructions.

Delete recipes.

Search for recipes by name or ingredients.

Filter recipes by specific criteria 
(e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free).

Sort recipes by name or rating.

Rate recipes on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.

Your task is to design the React components and 
implement the logic to build this recipe management
 application. Each recipe should be represented as an object 
 with properties like name, ingredients (an array), instructions,
 and rating. Ensure that you efficiently manage and 
 manipulate the recipes data based on user interactions
