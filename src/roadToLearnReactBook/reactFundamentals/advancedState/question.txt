Imagine you are building a data table component in a React application. Each row in the table represents an item, and you want to implement functionality to delete items. 
You decide to use the useReducer hook to manage the state of your table.

Define the initial state:

Set up the initial state for your data table.
 Assume that each item has an id, name, and quantity property.
Define the reducer function:

Create a reducer function that handles the state transitions for deleting an item.
The reducer should remove an item based on its id when a "DELETE_ITEM" action
 is dispatched.
Initialize the state using useReducer:

Initialize the state in your component using the useReducer hook, 
using the initial state and the reducer function.
Render the table:

Render a table with at least 10 rows of sample data.
 Each row should display the item's id, name, quantity, 
 and a delete button. Clicking the delete button should trigger
  the dispatch of the "DELETE_ITEM" action.
