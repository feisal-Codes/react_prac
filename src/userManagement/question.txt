You are tasked with creating a User Management System in React. 
The system should display a list of users with the following information:

User ID
Name
Email
Role (e.g., Admin, Moderator, User)
Registration Date
The system should have the following functionalities:

Display Users:

Display a list of users with their details.
Initially, show all users.
Filter Users:

Allow users to filter the displayed users based on their roles (Admin, Moderator, User).
Allow users to search for a specific user by name or email.
Sort Users:

Allow users to sort the displayed users based on their registration date.
Provide an option to sort in ascending or descending order.
User Details:

Allow users to click on a user to view more details.
Display additional details for the selected user.
Add New User:

Allow users to add a new user to the system.
Capture the necessary details (Name, Email, Role).
Edit User:

Allow users to edit the details of an existing user.
Provide a form to modify user information.
Delete User:

Allow users to delete a user.
Additional Notes:

Use React state and props effectively to 
manage the user data and application state.
Consider creating separate components for different parts of the application (e.g., UserList, UserFilter, UserDetails, etc.).
